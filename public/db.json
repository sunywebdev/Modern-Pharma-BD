In the healthcare industry, it is used in laboratories to make diagnoses from biopsies or other biological sample preparations. Microscopes are usually a lens system that magnifies the object under observation. There are also examination and/or surgical microscopes used to magnify an area of the body so the doctor or surgeon can work more accurately.
